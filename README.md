- Finished video section.
    - why used `<iframe></iframe>` instead of `<video></video>`?
- Started tutorial section.
    - original source uses an anchor tag (`<a>`) but I thought `<button>` suits more here since we're not really navigating anywhere.

- Partially finished tutorial parts.
- I thought the code part was an image but it was done in CSS... *wow*
